            The smoothest page zoom on the internet<br />
            ⁠— Highly customizable with many features!<br /><br />Simply
            position the cursor and use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out at the
            desired location. You can compare this extension to pinch-and-zoom
            functionality on touch screens, or a Windows Magnifier.
            <br /><br />Many touchpads support pinch-and-zoom in a way that they
            trigger the built-in page zoom. You can intercept this action if you
            change the zoom activation key from "RClick" to "Ctrl". This way,
            you don't need a mouse wheel to use SmoothZoom!

        <strong>
          Hi! I'm a solo developer of SmoothZoom browser extension.
        </strong>
        <hr />
        Here's a list of issues that cannot be solved with current browser
        technology:
        <details>
          <summary>
            Elements with fixed position
            <strong style="color: red">High importance</strong>
          </summary>
          When zooming, the root element gets the transform style and
          consequently creates a containing block for absolute and fixed
          positioned descendants. To preserve their position on the viewport,
          they have to position with scroll distance added to their coordinates.
          The problem is in locating these elements. One method, that 100%
          works, is to query all elements in the DOM, call
          <em>getComputedStyle</em> on each one of them and get the position
          property. Of course, this is unacceptably slow because it has to
          happen the moment before the zoom starts. The current method works by
          reading all document stylesheets, extracting selectors of rules with a
          fixed position, and finally, using only these selectors on the first
          method. The problem is when a stylesheet is cross-origin because the
          CORS error raises when trying to read it.
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/debugger/"
            target="_blank"
            >Debugger API</a
          >
          can access all loaded resources, which implies it is possible to
          locate wanted selectors in CSS strings. After implementing this
          method, I concluded that it works in all cases, but I decided not to
          go with it. Here are the reasons why:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The message
              <em>"SmoothZoom extension started debugging this browser."</em>
              appears in a large infobar label that moves the page away from the
              top of the viewport.
            </li>
            <li>
              The debugger API is not available as optional permission. It also
              brings up this warning on installation:
              <em>"Access the page debugger backend."</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              The process of attaching the debugger itself is slow and requires
              many async calls. There is a noticeable difference in waiting
              time, the moment before the zoom starts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Sandboxed frame elements<strong style="color: orange"
              >Medium</strong
            >
          </summary>
          The extension works even when frames are nested and dynamically
          created. Each frame gets a "messenger" function which propagates
          registered events up to the top frame. The top frame shares the
          current zoom state object with all the other frames so that each stays
          synchronized. However, some frames with strict sandbox attribute don't
          allow content script injection and therefore it is impossible to
          register any events while the cursor is hovering over them. For
          example, this can happen with Google Ads. To zoom towards an element
          like this, the only solution is to disable interactivity (option from
          the popup), trigger the zoom anywhere around it, and finally zoom
          inside that element.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Fullscreen problems<strong style="color: orange">Medium</strong>
          </summary>
          It is impossible to zoom a fullscreen element. However, I found a
          workaround — The moment before zoom starts, the extension exits
          fullscreen and makes the root element go fullscreen instead. This way,
          the element that was previously in fullscreen is now zoomable. It
          becomes temporarily fixed positioned to cover the entire viewport,
          which leads to another problem if it is nested. Instead of changing
          its position in DOM, all its ancestors temporarily need to have the
          highest specificity style that defines values: filter, transform,
          backdrop-filter, perspective, contain, transform-style,
          content-visibility, and will-change as none or initial. These are the
          properties that result in the creation of a containing block for
          absolute and fixed positioned descendants. Lastly, to request
          fullscreen on an element, the user must interact twice because each
          call on
          <em>requestFullscreen</em> "eats" the user's event, which explains why
          the "Hold to zoom" option from the popup appears disabled. The
          remaining problem is:
          <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71637367/requestfullscreen-not-working-with-modifier-keys-inside-keyup-event"
            target="_blank"
            >requestFullscreen() not working with modifier keys inside keyup
            event</a
          >, meaning it is impossible to go fullscreen if the zoom activation
          key is Alt, Ctrl, or Shift. My question on StackOverflow still has
          zero answers.

            Toggling JavaScript<strong style="color: green">Low</strong>
          </summary>
          It is possible to toggle Javascript with
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/contentSettings/"
            >Content Settings API</a
          >, and it would be great if this was one of the options in the
          extension's popup. Zooming with temporarily disabled JavaScript
          prevents potential content adjusting and could improve performance
          significantly. However, toggling Javascript is not possible without
          reloading the page. Another problem is that the API toggles JavaScript
          for <em>all</em> pages that match the given location origin. On top of
          that, this API requires permission with possibly the scariest user
          warning:
          <em
            >"Change your settings that control websites' access to features
            such as cookies, JavaScript, plugins, geolocation, microphone,
            camera etc."</em
          >. DevTools Debugger has the option to toggle JavaScript instantly,
          per tab, but there is no way to access it programmatically.
