What is the purpose of your extension? Describe the value it provides to Chrome users. *
Zooming into websites or documents such as png or mp4, without changing the page layout. Simple, fast, configurable.
How should your extension be used? Provide examples of main use cases. *
You see a funny-looking profile picture and want to zoom into it as easy as possible -- I'd say this would be the primary use case. Totally different than the built-in browser zoom, and with many options, it can have lots of use cases. Especially useful for reading small texts without changing the page layout. Great for content creators. I believe it has massive potential.

An extension can only be considered for self-nomination review once every 6 months.
