          Hi! I'm a solo developer of SmoothZoom browser extension.
        </strong>
        <hr />
        Here's a list of issues that cannot be solved with current browser
        technology:
        <details>
          <summary>
            Elements with fixed position
            <strong style="color: red">High importance</strong>
          </summary>
          When zooming, the root element gets the transform style, and this
          creates a containing block for absolute and fixed positioned
          descendants. In order to keep their position on the viewport, they
          have to position with scroll distance addition to their coordinates.
          The problem is in locating these elements. One method, that 100%
          works, is to query all elements in the DOM, call
          <em>getComputedStyle</em> on each one of them, and get the position
          property. Of course, this is unacceptably slow because it has to
          happen moment before the zoom starts. The current method works by
          reading all document stylesheets, extracting selectors of rules with
          fixed position, and finally, using only these selectors on the first
          method. The problem is when a stylesheet is cross-origin, because the
          CORS error raises when trying to read it.
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/debugger/"
            target="_blank"
            >Debugger API</a
          >
          can access all loaded resources, meaning it is possible to locate
          wanted selectors in CSS strings. After implementing this method, I
          came to a conclusion that it works perfectly, covering all cases, but
          I decided not to go with it. Here are the reasons why:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The message
              <em>"SmoothZoom extension started debugging this browser."</em>
              appears in a large infobar label that moves the page away from the
              top of the viewport.
            </li>
            <li>
              The debugger API is not available as optional permission. It also
              brings up this warning on installation:
              <em>"Access the page debugger backend."</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              The process of attaching the debugger itself is slow and requires
              many async calls. There is a noticable difference in waiting time,
              moment before the zoom starts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Sandboxed frame elements<strong style="color: orange"
              >Medium</strong
            >
          </summary>
          The extension works even when frames are nested and dynamically
          created. Each frame gets a "messenger" function which propagates
          registered events up to the top frame. The top frame shares the
          current zoom state object with all the other frames so that each stays
          synchronized. However, some frames with strict sandbox attribute don't
          allow content script injection and therefore it is impossible to
          register any events while cursor is hovering them. For example, this
          can happen with Google Ads. To zoom towards such element, the only
          solution is to disable interactivity (option from the popup), trigger
          the zoom anywhere around it, and finally zoom inside that element.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Fullscreen problems<strong style="color: orange">Medium</strong>
          </summary>
          It is impossible to zoom a fullscreen element. However, I found a
          workaround â€” Moment before zoom starts, the extension exits fullscreen
          and makes the root element go fullscreen instead. This way, the
          element that was previously in fullscreen can now be zoomed. It
          becomes temporarily fixed positioned to cover the entire viewport, but
          because it can be nested, there is another problem. Instead of
          changing its position in DOM, all its ancestors need to have,
          temporarily, the highest specificity style which defines values:
          filter, transform, backdrop-filter, perspective, contain,
          transform-style, content-visibility, and will-change as none or
          initial. These are the properties that result in the creation of a
          containing block for absolute and fixed positioned descendants. The
          remaning problem is this:
          <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71637367/requestfullscreen-not-working-with-modifier-keys-inside-keyup-event"
            target="_blank"
            >requestFullscreen() not working with modifier keys inside keyup
            event</a
          >, meaning it is impossible to go fullscreen if the zoom activation
          key is Alt, Ctrl, or Shift. My question on StackOverflow still has
          zero answers.

          <summary>
            Toggling JavaScript<strong style="color: green">Low</strong>
          </summary>
          It is possible to toggle Javascript with
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/contentSettings/"
            >Content Settings API</a
          >, and it would be great if this was one of the options in the
          extension's popup. Zooming with temporarily disabled JavaScript
          prevents potential content adjusting and could improve performance
          significantly. However, toggling Javascript is not possible without
          reloading the page. Another problem is that the API toggles JavaScript
          for <em>all</em> pages that match the given location origin. On top of
          that, this API requires a permission with possibly the scarriest user
          warning:
          <em
            >"Change your settings that control websites' access to features
            such as cookies, JavaScript, plugins, geolocation, microphone,
            camera etc."</em
          >. DevTools Debugger has the option to toggle JavaScript instantly,
          per tab, but there is no way to access it programmatically.
